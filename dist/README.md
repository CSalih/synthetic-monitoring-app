Worldping application
=====================

Worldping is a black box monitoring solution that provides users with
insights into how their applications and services are behaving from an
external point of view. It complements the insights from within the
applications and services we already provide through our existing
Metrics and Logs services at the core of our Grafana Cloud platform.

Worldping is also a demonstration of how use-case specific applications
can be built on top of Grafana and Grafana Cloud. It is the successor to
the original [worldping
application](https://grafana.net/plugins/raintank-worldping-app). The
refreshed worldping product focuses on reducing complexity and taking
advantage of Grafana Cloud capabilities.

This is the application frontend.
